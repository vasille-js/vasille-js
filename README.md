## How SAFE is Vasille

The safe of your application is ensured by
* `100%` coverage of code by unit tests.
  Each function, each branch is working as designed.
* OOP, DRY, KISS and SOLID principles are applied.
* `strong typing` makes your javascript/typescript code safe as C++ code.
All entities of `vasille` core library are strongly typed, including:
  * data fields & properties.
  * computed properties (function parameters & result).
  * methods.
  * events (defined handlers & event emit).
  * DOM events & DOM operation (attributing, styling, etc.).
  * slots of components.
  * references to children.
* No asynchronous code, when the line of code is executed, the DOM and reactive things are already synced.

## How SIMPLE is Vasille

There is the "Hello World":
```typescript jsx
import { compose, mount } from "vasille-dx";

const App = compose(() => {
  <p>Hello world</p>;
});

mount(document.body, App, {});
```

## How POWERFUL is Vasille

All of these are supported:
* Components.
* Reactive values (observables).
* Inline computed values.
* Multiline computed values.
* HTML & SVG tags.
* Component custom slots.
* 2-way data binding in components.
* Logic block (if, else).
* Loops (array, map, set).
